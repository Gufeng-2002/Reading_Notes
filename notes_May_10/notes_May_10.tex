\title{Summary about dissertation of Zhang (2008) and Vercruysse (2022)Thesis work}

    {\Large Abstract}
\end{center}

    In Part 1 and 2 of this document, i summarized the work of Zhang (2008) and Vercruysse et al. (2017) by listing the data, methods and results presented in their work.
    It can be skipped if the summary is not of interest.

    In part 3, i did some coding with simualted data to see how can i quickly reproduce similar results and how could i extend the work.
    These ideas are tentative and not fully developed yet, but i think it is a good start and worth to be included in the report.

The major exploration i did can be concentrated into the figure below, which shows the geographic/spatial exploration(a), 
breakpoint quantile regression(b, c) and PCA by SVD(d).

The code and supportive files can be found in this \textbf{GitHub repository}: \href{https://github.com/Gufeng-2002/Reading_Notes/tree/main}{\textit{src\_test(source of code)}.}

\section{How can i reproduce and extend the work?}
\subsection{Geographic visualization and spitial analysis by coding}

I found in several places in the papers, the authors used geographic maps to show the location of 
survery sites and did spitial analysis on them. To might make the visualization more clear and the analysis
more efficient, i can use librarys like \textit{geopandas} and \textit{geopy} 
in python to do the geographic visualization and spatial analysis. 
They may provide more possibilities to explore and extend the work of Zhang (2008) and Vercruysse et al. (2017) and might
be a powerful tool for spitial data.

    \caption{\textit{Example of a map showing the location of Kamloops and Vancouver in BC. 4 points and two lines were added to the map.}}
    \label{fig:test_BC_map}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:test_BC_map} shows an example of a map showing the location of Kamloops and Vancouver in BC.
I downloaded the geographic data from government website, including: \href{https://open.canada.ca/data/en/dataset/a883eb14-0c0e-45c4-b8c4-b54c4a819edb/resource/12c03de6-c3f7-4f5f-bb5c-d479f2332842}{\textit{open.canada.ca}} and 
\href{https://catalogue.data.gov.bc.ca/dataset/municipalities-legally-defined-administrative-areas-of-bc/resource/0bd8e3d1-4d7f-4db8-a8b2-2cd4cd051074}{\textit{catalogue.data.gov.bc.ca}}. They provide the provincial and municipal boundaries of BC.

I managed to add basic geographic elements to the map, like points, lines and polygons and it worked well. If this part is considered worth to be included, 
i would spcifically try to create maps for Ontario Province with the Lake Huron-Lake Erie area and the Alberta Province with the fen complex distribution.

\subsection{Breakpoint quantile regression}

The detailed math part of breakpoint quantile regression is not discussed here, it could be left to work on later.
I tried to reproduce a similar result by using simulated data to validate the implementation with Python and my own code.

\paragraph{Continuous Breakpoint Regression:}
In continuous breakpoint regression, the relationship between the independent variable \(x\) and the dependent variable \(y\) is modeled such that the function remains continuous at the breakpoint \(c\). For example:

\[
y = 
\begin{cases} 
\beta_0 + \beta_1 x & \text{if } x \leq c \\
\beta_0 + \beta_1 c + \beta_2 (x - c) & \text{if } x > c
\end{cases}
\]

\paragraph{Discontinuous Breakpoint Regression:}
In discontinuous breakpoint regression, the relationship between \(x\) and \(y\) is allowed to have a jump at the breakpoint \(c\). For example:

\[
y = 
\begin{cases} 
\beta_0 + \beta_1 x & \text{if } x \leq c \\
\beta_2 + \beta_3 x & \text{if } x > c
\end{cases}
\]

\begin{figure}[!h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{../src_test/results/breakpoint_quantile_regression.png}
    \caption{\textit{Example of breakpoint quantile regression}}
    \label{fig:breakpoint_quantile_regression}
\end{figure}

It looks great, similar to one of the results by Vercruysse's work.

Later, i will try to incorporate this method with Bayesian formula and other methods to try to get a better result.


\subsection{PCA by Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)}

PCA is a method that was used in both Zhang's and Vercruysse 's work, i am also interested in this method.

These days i am reading the book \textit{Introduction to Linear Algebra, Fifth Edition(Gilbert Strang)} and very interested in the part
about singular value decomposition(SVD) and its importance in achieving PCA. Therefore, i tried to implement PCA using SVD by linear algebra 
with Python.

The SVD of \( X_c \) is given by:
\[
X_c = U \Sigma V^T
\]
where:
- \( U \) is an \( m \times m \) orthogonal matrix,
- \( \Sigma \) is an \( m \times n \) diagonal matrix with singular values on the diagonal,
- \( V \) is an \( n \times n \) orthogonal matrix.


The transformed data in the reduced space is given by:
\[
X_{\text{PCA}} = X_c V_k
\]
where \( V_k \) contains the top \( k \) principal components.

The reason of using SVD is that i want to try to adjust the PCA method and incoporate it with other methods 
to make it more flexible and specific for the data on hand.

\begin{figure}[!h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{../src_test/results/pca_svd.png}
    \caption{\textit{Example of PCA and SVD on the simulated data}}
    \label{fig:pca_svd}
\end{figure}

For example, figure \ref{fig:pca_svd} shows the PCA result by SVD, which is upon a simulated data.
One tentative idea could be to find a way to use less data(samples) to get relatively accurate 
singular values and vectors, which can be used to save time and effort in collecting data and computation.

\begin{figure}[!h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{../src_test/results/pca_svd_sampled_data.png}
    \caption{\textit{Example of PCA and SVD on sampled data from the simulated data}}
    \label{fig:pca_svd_2}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:pca_svd_2} shows the PCA result by SVD, which is upon different sampled sub-data from the 
original simulated data. The result is not as good as the one in figure \ref{fig:pca_svd}, which uses the whole data.
But this can be an aspect to explore along the work.
